        content: "Dear Little Weirdo,<br><br>Happy Friendship Day.<br>Honestly, even writing this feels strange — not because I don’t have anything to say, but because there’s so much I’ve never said.<br><br>We met in the most random way — two strangers bonding over One Direction (thank you, internet and Harry Styles).<br>We started dating in May, and those first few weeks felt light — like a breath of fresh air.<br>You were passionate, expressive, and wore your heart on your sleeve. I, on the other hand, took more time to react. And while we had our share of misunderstandings, I always tried to be the one who listened — to understand what was really going on beneath the words. Not because I was always right, but because I genuinely wanted to meet you where you were emotionally.<br><br>I tried to hold space for your anger, your silence, your hurt — even when I didn’t always know how.<br>You got angry quickly. I didn’t. Even when it didn’t feel like my fault, I always tried to calm things down — to understand, to fix what broke.<br>And slowly, I even found creative ways to reach you. I’d say, “Okay, let’s pretend I’m just your friend. Talk to me like I don’t know what’s going on — tell me what hurt you, what upset you, and I’ll take your side.” It sounds silly, but it worked. We laughed through those fights. We made it through.<br><br>But over time, it started to feel one-sided from my perspective it might be a different from yours. Every fight, I was the one apologizing. The one solving it. And that didn’t mean I wasn’t hurting too — I just stopped showing it. It’s like I took on the role of peacekeeper and forgot I had my own breaking points. And then you said something that really stuck with me:<br>“You’re not the same person I fell in love with.”<br>It cut deep — not because it was harsh, but because I had tried so hard to be everything for you.<br>Tried different ways to make it work. Tried to keep the bond from falling apart. But somewhere in the process, I stopped feeling seen.<br><br>December was heavy. We were fighting more than ever. You kept asking if I was going to break up. I could feel it — the distance, the tension, the end creeping in. And one thing about me that you’ve probably seen: When I feel heartbreak coming, I run. I start pulling away, creating space, making things messy — not because I don’t care, but because I care too much. I distance myself when I think I’m going to get heartbroken. Not because I stop loving, but because I’m terrified of being left. So I make it look like I left — like it was my choice. That way, at least the pain feels like something I had control over. And yes, I know that’s unhealthy. But it’s something I’ve done for years. Because the idea of staying… hoping… and still being left — that’s a pain I’ve never learned to survive. You’ve seen this in me. Even this time when I thought you lied — I didn’t ask, I didn’t clarify, I just reacted.<br><br>I jumped to conclusions not because I didn’t trust you… But because, deep down, I thought maybe I didn’t matter enough for the truth. So I left first. But what I didn’t expect — what I wasn’t ready for — was the silence that followed.<br>\"I left with heavy feet,<br>hoping you'd hold the door.<br>But you stood silent —<br>and that silence hurt more.\"<br><br>I know you were hurt too. And maybe, in your own way, that silence was your reaction. But selfishly, I wished you’d stopped me. Shouted, cursed, something. Just to show I mattered as much as you always said I did.<br>But the truth is — through all of this — you’ve been the person I trusted most.<br><br>I’ve had a rough childhood. There were things I never talked about. I always acted like life was great, even when I was drowning. I smiled when I was breaking. I joked when I was hurting. I kept everyone at arm’s length — because that felt safer than being seen.<br>But with you… I didn’t have to pretend.<br>“We met through pixels,<br>not people.<br>But even behind a screen,<br>you felt like someone real.”<br><br>You’re the first person I ever opened up to.<br>The first one I could say, “I’m not okay” to — and not feel judged or pitied.<br>You’ve seen me at my most confused, distant, overthinking worst — and still chose to stay.<br>That’s not just friendship.<br>That’s loyalty.<br>That’s love in its most honest, platonic form.<br><br>Even when we were in a relationship, I used to call you “dumb” — jokingly, of course — but I know it probably didn’t feel good, especially when you’d just shared something serious or emotional. Even after the CAT results, I reminded you that your score was low — when mine wasn’t any better. I don’t know why I did that. Maybe I thought it was playful. But looking back, it was unfair.<br>Because you never did that to me.<br>You never made me feel small — not when I failed, not when I was lost, not even when I deserved it.<br>You never called me dumb or useless, not even once.<br>You always found a way to make me feel better about myself, no matter how bad I was doing.<br>That’s the kind of friend you were to me — and I honestly don’t think I deserved it.<br><br>And also I want to say something I haven’t really acknowledged until now:<br>You were an amazing friend.<br>And I… I wasn’t.<br>You always listened when I came to you with problems. You supported me, no matter how small or silly the issue was.<br>But when you came to me — when you were upset or frustrated — I didn’t offer the same care. Instead of just being there for you, I picked apart the situation. I pointed out your small mistakes — even when I knew deep down you weren’t really wrong.<br>You told me once about a fight with your parents, and I remember interrupting with, “But maybe you could have done this differently…”<br>What I should’ve done was listen. Just listen.<br><br>Even the moments you were excited — like buying that Stanley bottle or talking about Labubu — I wasn’t happy for you. I was dismissive.<br>I called it a waste of money.<br>I criticized things that brought you joy.<br>And I regret that more than you know.<br><br>You were so much better to me than I ever was to you.<br>And sometimes, I wonder why you even stayed.<br>Maybe I didn’t deserve to be your friend.<br>But I want to try to be a better one now.<br>I want to listen without interrupting.<br>I want to be happy with you — not just for you — and genuinely try to understand the things that make you smile, even if they’re new or unfamiliar to me.<br>The way you always listened when I shared my problems, even when I didn’t deserve that space…<br>The way you cheered for my football team — something you don’t even understand — just because it mattered to me…<br>I want to do the same for you now.<br>I hope I become someone you can open up to again — especially about your parents.<br>You’ve said before, “You won’t understand,” and stopped sharing — and I never want you to feel that way with me again.<br><br>So thank you.<br>For being you.<br>For calling me out when I’m wrong.<br>For letting me be dark and messy without flinching.<br>For staying, even when it was hard to.<br><br>I don’t know what the future holds.<br>Maybe one day we’ll meet. Maybe we won’t.<br>But I hope you’ll always be around — yelling, laughing, oversharing, and being unapologetically you.<br><br>Happy Friendship Day,<br>Your Kevin"

        content: "We met in the most random way — through Instagram, of all places — and bonded over One Direction like two fans who thought no one else could possibly understand.<br>Soon, it wasn’t just about songs; we were watching and laughing about Bridgerton.<br><br>At the time, I wasn’t sure if you’d ever like me back. So, in my own awkward way, I asked you, “I think I have a crush on someone, what should I do?”<br>What I was really doing was testing the waters with you — and honestly, I thought it would end there.<br><br>Then life hit you hard when Delilah passed away. I still remember how devastated you were — and how, even in that moment of pain, you let me in.<br>That’s when our bond became real, deeper than just music or shows, because you trusted me with your grief.<br><br>And yet, classic me, I almost ruined it before it began.<br>I said we should stop talking because “I think I have feelings for you and maybe they’ll go away.” Probably one of the dumbest things I’ve ever said.<br>But to my surprise, you didn’t let me run — you simply said, “I like you too, why don’t we try dating?”<br>That moment has stayed with me, because it showed how you were always braver, always willing to choose us, even when I doubted.<br><br>Being with you never felt like work. I didn’t have to pretend or act cool; I could just be me — the real me.<br>And that’s what I loved the most. It wasn’t about some big romantic moment; it was about the little things.<br>The silly fights we had over nothing, the playful banters that went nowhere but still made us laugh, and the way we gave each other ridiculous names.<br>I still remember calling you my “little weirdo” or “Bob” from Minions.<br>Those weren’t just names — they were proof of how comfortable and happy I felt with you.<br>With you, I never had to earn my place — I just belonged.<br><br>But then came the harder part of our story.<br>Around October 2022, the little fights started piling up. At first, I tried my best to solve everything, even in creative ways.<br>I still remember once I told you, “Let me be your friend for a moment, tell me what happened so I can understand your side.”<br>And it worked — we understood each other better that way.<br><br>But over time, it started to feel one-sided. Whenever something broke, I tried fixing it, but deep down I was hurting too.<br>Some of the things said left scars, and I never really showed how much they affected me.<br><br>I’ll never forget when you told me, “You ain’t the same Mahir.”<br>Those words cut deep, because you were right — I wasn’t the same.<br>I was overwhelmed, confused, and honestly, immature in how I handled everything.<br><br>By December, the fights hadn’t stopped. You kept asking me, “Are you going to break up?” again and again, and in my mind, it felt like maybe you wanted it too.<br>So I thought — instead of waiting to be left, maybe I should mess everything up myself so it hurts less if you did it first.<br><br>At the same time, life outside us was falling apart too.<br>My dad had lost his job, my parents were fighting constantly, and I didn’t know how to carry so much at once.<br>I was young, I was scared, and I didn’t know how to balance my feelings, my family, and us.<br>And in that storm, I lost you.<br><br>After the breakup, there was silence. A whole year where we didn’t speak.<br>I tried to move on, bury myself in other things, but somewhere inside, I kept missing you.<br>Then, one random day, I gave in. I messaged you.<br>Of course, I didn’t have the courage to say, “I miss you, I still want you,” so I pretended — pretended it was just about being friends.<br><br>But what I didn’t expect was how naturally we slipped back into talking.<br>Slowly, we did become great friends. And honestly, that friendship has been one of the most comforting parts of my life.<br><br>You never made me feel small — not when I failed, not when I was lost, not even when I probably deserved it.<br>You never called me dumb or useless, not even once.<br>Somehow, you always knew how to lift me back up when I was down.<br>That’s the kind of friend you were to me — the kind of friend I honestly don’t think I deserved.<br><br>And there’s something I’ve never really admitted until now: you were an amazing friend… and I wasn’t.<br>You always listened when I came to you with problems, no matter how small or silly.<br>You gave me your full attention, even when I didn’t deserve it.<br>But when it was your turn — when you were upset, or when something had hurt you — I didn’t offer the same care.<br>Instead of just being there for you, I tried to dissect the situation, point out little things you “could’ve done differently,” as if that would fix anything.<br>It didn’t.<br>What you needed was someone to simply listen, someone to stand with you in the feeling. And I failed you there.<br><br>Even in the moments you were happy, I wasn’t always who you needed me to be.<br>Like when you bought that Stanley bottle or when you talked about Labubu — you were so excited, but instead of sharing that joy with you, I dismissed it.<br>I called it a waste of money, or brushed it off like it didn’t matter.<br>But it did matter. It mattered to you — and that should’ve been enough for me.<br>I regret those moments more than I can explain.<br><br>You were so much better to me than I ever was to you.<br>And sometimes, I truly wonder why you stayed.<br>Why you didn’t walk away sooner.<br>Maybe I didn’t deserve the patience, the kindness, or the space you gave me.<br>But now, I want to try and earn it.<br><br>I want to be a better friend to you.<br>I want to listen without interrupting.<br>I want to celebrate the things that make you smile, even if they’re things I don’t fully understand at first.<br>I want to be curious about your world — the little things that light you up — instead of dismissing them.<br><br>The way you always listened when I ranted about my football team, even though you barely knew the rules — you still cheered, just because it mattered to me.<br>I want to do the same for you now.<br><br>I know there were times you held back from sharing with me, especially about your parents.<br>You once told me, “You won’t understand,” and that broke me.<br>Because you were right — I had given you no reason to believe I could.<br>I never want you to feel that way with me again.<br><br>So thank you.<br>For being you.<br>For calling me out when I was wrong.<br>For letting me be dark and messy without flinching.<br>For staying, even when it was hard.<br><br>I think what I love the most is that with you, I can just be me.<br>No masks, no acting, no pretending to be tougher or smarter than I am.<br>I can be vulnerable, I can be silly, I can even be weak — and you never use it against me.<br><br>I love our banters, the little back-and-forths where we tease each other and laugh over nothing.<br>I love that I can share things I wouldn’t tell anyone else, because I know you’ll actually listen.<br>And I love how, even in my lowest moments, you never make me feel small.<br>You’re always there for me. You support me, you back me up, and you never belittle me.<br><br>With you, I don’t feel judged. I just feel… understood. And that’s rare.<br><br>Looking back, I know I fell short.<br>I didn’t always listen when you needed me.<br>I dismissed things that brought you joy.<br>I picked apart your pain instead of simply holding it with you.<br>In short — you gave me your best, and I didn’t always give you mine.<br>That’s my biggest regret.<br><br>But here’s what I want you to know: I’ve learned from that.<br>I don’t want to run away when things get hard.<br>I want to stay, to always try and find a way through — together.<br>I want to listen without judgment, to celebrate your little joys, and to support you the way you’ve always supported me.<br><br>I want to build a better career, not just for myself, but so I can build a life we can both be proud of.<br>I want to explore the world with you — to see new places, create new memories, and live a story that’s ours.<br>Most of all, I want to be better for you. Because you deserve nothing less.<br>And maybe I never said this enough, but being with you has made me feel more human than anything else in my life.<br>Before you, I didn’t feel much — not too happy even when I was out trekking, not too sad even when my dad was in a serious condition with Covid.<br>I wanted to feel, but I couldn’t.<br>With you, I felt everything.<br>You made me the happiest.<br>Your little nakhre never annoyed me — they made me want to solve them.<br>Our banters, our silly talks, even the jealousy, the insecurity, the fear of losing you… all of it, mixed with love, made me realize what it means to be alive.<br><br>Because of you, I feel human.<br><br>I can wait. Take as long as you want.<br>I will try my best every day to become the person who truly deserves you.<br>I will wait, because in the end, it’s only you I want to end up with.<br><br>It hurts that you’re not mine right now.<br>It hurts even more that I was too shy to say “I love you” at the end of our calls before — and now, it hurts that I can’t say it at all.<br>Your Kevin"

        date: "2025-09-17",
        content: "Today I’m writing to clear the fog in my head and own what I feel — without blaming her, without pretending I’m not hurt.<br><br>I hurt because she won’t share things with me. It stings more than I expected. She once told me my biggest flaw is communication — and she’s right. I don’t talk easily. I’ve never been the kind of person who tells friends or family what’s really going on; I keep it inside. So when I asked her to open up, part of that was selfish hope — I wanted the one person I cared about most to be the one I could trust with everything. I thought she might do for me what I never do for others.<br><br>Until last month, I thought I knew her completely. In my mind, she’s the type who—even if someone hurts her—can’t stay a total stranger to them forever. She softens with time, finds a way to talk again. That’s one of the things I admire most: her kindness runs deep. And I’ve seen it firsthand. She never blamed me for the breakup, even though I never gave her closure. She kept talking, kept being kind, when she had every reason not to.<br><br>That’s why this silence hurts. Last week she said she wouldn’t tell me things, and I thought I understood. But then after the Rajat incident, she mentioned more than once that she’d stopped talking to him. Hearing that made me think maybe, finally, she could share. He was one of the closest people in her life, and I understood why she’d protect that — I respect loyalty and boundaries. What confused me was that now she isn’t talking to him at all, and I couldn’t make sense of why she still couldn’t share this with me. That confusion turned into a sharp fear: not just of losing her, but of realizing maybe I didn’t know her the way I thought I did.<br><br>When she wanted to rant, I genuinely tried to listen. I wasn’t just digging for details; I wanted to understand her feelings. So when she said, “I don’t know why I’m feeling this,” I asked her to try to explain — because in my mind, putting words to feelings makes them easier to carry. But she thought I only cared about Rajat. And then came the line: “Mahir wouldn’t do that to Rajat.” Why that comparison? He’s her friend, sure, but in my eyes he acted a little desperate for a random girl. I couldn’t understand why his actions made her so sad and angry. It left me with this uneasy thought — that she saw my care for her as curiosity about him.<br><br>I want to be honest with myself: this isn’t just insecurity. It’s the ache of realizing that the image I had of her — the person I thought I fully knew — doesn’t always match reality. And that hurts. Still, I should have listened more and asked less like an interrogation. I should have said, “I want to understand you,” instead of letting it sound like I was chasing someone else’s name.<br><br>I’m sorry — to her, and to myself. Sorry for letting fear and confusion speak louder than honesty. Sorry for expecting her to give me what I struggle to give others. Sorry for making her feel pressured or misunderstood.<br><br>What I want now is clarity and gentleness. I want to learn to say my feelings without making them sound like blame. I want to respect her boundaries and still be able to say, plainly: I felt left out, I felt afraid, I felt confused. I don’t need her to fix that for me; I just needed her to know it. And if she can’t share, I want to understand that without turning it into a fight.<br><br>If I could go back, I would have been quieter with my demands and louder with my truth: “I’m scared. I didn’t break up because of you. I broke up because my life felt unstable and I didn’t want to drag you into my mess. I hoped you would be different, and it hurts that you can’t share this with me. I accept your choice, but I need you to know why I feel the way I do.”<br><br>This entry is both an apology and a promise — to work on communication, to stop letting fear cloud my intentions, and to accept that she has her own reasons for staying quiet. I owe her the respect of patience, and I owe myself the courage to speak honestly without demanding answers.<br><br>— Kevin"
